# for Loops

# range takes start, stop, step paramters, passing just one defaults to just "stop", "step" states how our iteration should flow and start is actually the starting point, NOTE: stop value isn't included

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    
    # start at 1, stop at 9, increment by 2 on every iteration
for i in range(1,10,2):
    print(i)
